# Winget Configuration File Generator

This repository contains a library that can help to create a WinGet configuration file following the guidelines described in [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/configuration/create)

This library is used by scnorionplus to generate the configuration files that contains the desired state expressed by the admin in the scnorionplus console and are executed by scnorionplus agents.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: This library is not considered ready to use, it's a Proof of Concept and a WIP
